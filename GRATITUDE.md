<h1 align="center">Gratitude 💌</h1>

First of all, I want to thank God for helping me at all times and when I need it most and my family for supporting me and motivating me when decided to study this career.💚

Also, I would like to thank:

* [**_FR_**](https://github.com/fander-v) => For their great support and motivation, especially at times when I thought that because I didn't have a PC I couldn't continue. In addition to the +20 questions I asked him daily hahaha. 😅
* [**_Leandro_**](https://github.com/Le-Mark) => For recommending the code editor with which I was able to start developing from my tablet and cell phone. In addition to the great support he gave me when I told him about the idea of creating this project. 🌠
* **_Jaspe_** => For helping me with the translations that were necessary for the names of certain icons. 🎉
* [**_Csc32_**](https://github.com/Csc32) => For your support and help when asking your opinions for certain things that were added since v2. 💥

And to you reader, who may be a developer, for taking the time to see this project. 👻
